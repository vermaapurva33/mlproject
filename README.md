## End-to-End ML Project

This repository provides a comprehensive example of a machine learning project, covering all major stages from data acquisition to deployment. The goal is to illustrate best practices and a reproducible workflow for real-world ML applications.

### Key Components

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Scripts and notebooks for gathering raw data, handling missing values, normalization, and splitting datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential issues.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques for creating, selecting, and transforming features to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection & Training:** Implementation of various algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to identify the best model.
- **Model Evaluation & Validation:** Metrics and plots (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curves) to assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and robustness.
- **Model Deployment:** Packaging the trained model for production use, including API endpoints or batch inference scripts.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlproject.git
    cd mlproject
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Prepare the data:**  
   Place your raw data in the `data/` directory or use provided scripts to download datasets.
4. **Run EDA and preprocessing:**  
   Open the relevant notebooks in `notebooks/` or execute scripts in `src/` to explore and clean the data.
5. **Train and evaluate models:**  
   Use the training scripts or notebooks to build and assess models. Results and artifacts will be saved in `models/`.
6. **Deploy the model:**  
   Follow deployment instructions in the documentation or use provided scripts to serve the model via an API or batch process.
